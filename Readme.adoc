= Brainfuck to zig compiler

Have you ever wanted to have performance in your brainfuck code? Look no further.

This build scripts accepts a brainfuck file as the environment variable `BF_FILE_PATH`, generates a zig file with it, and compiles it as `program` in your usual `zig-out/bin` output folder.

As an example, `helloworld.bf` is available. On linux, just run `BF_FILE_PATH=./helloworld.bf zig build` to compile and generate.

The generated zig file is available in the `generated` folder for reference.
